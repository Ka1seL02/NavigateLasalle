                        <p>
                            On July 18, 1977, the institution was established as General Emilio Aguinaldo College
                            (GEAC)–Cavite,
                            under the management of Dr. Paulo C. Campos and the Yaman Lahi Foundation. It offered
                            courses in
                            education, business administration, nursing, midwifery, and allied health fields, marking
                            the

                        <p>
                            The small library of GEAC, initially just a classroom, was moved to the administration
                            building.
                            This laid the foundation for a more formal information resource center, supporting the
                            growing
                            academic community.

                            affordable, skills-based education to students and strengthening the college's role in
                            practical

                            Foundation,
                            a sister corporation of De La Salle University. It became a Lasallian institution and was
                            renamed
                            DLSU-EAC, embracing Catholic Lasallian values.
